The navigation controller is one of the <u>key concepts</u> in navigation.</br>
<b>It holds the navigation graph</b> and exposes methods that allow <b>your</br>
app to move between the destinations</b> in the graph.

When using the Navigation component, you create a navigation controller<br>
using the NavController class. NavController is the central navigation API.</br>
<b>It tracks which destinations the user has visited</b>, and allows the user</br>
to move between destinations. This guide demonstrates how to create a <br>
NavController in your app.

For information on how to add a navigation graph to your NavController, see Design your navigation graph. NavController provides a few different ways to navigate to the destinations in its graph. For more, see Navigate to a destination.
